                        <p>LEAD PYTHON DEVELOPER <br>
                            MARCH 2022 – PRESENT <br> <br> As a Lead Python Developer at Canopy Health, I’ve applied backend
                            engineering experience to build scalable, high-performance solutions for critical healthcare
                            systems. I led the architecture and development of backend services using Python and Golang,
                            focusing on HIPAA-compliant design, efficient data structures, and algorithm optimization.
                            My work included deploying serverless microservices on AWS (Lambda, ECS) and Google Cloud
                            (Cloud Functions), enabling greater scalability and operational efficiency. I implemented
                            advanced data analytics pipelines using NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to support real-time
                            reporting and predictive insights. To streamline releases and improve reliability, I
                            developed CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes. I collaborated in Agile
                            teams to align technical solutions with evolving business requirements, improving care
                            coordination and patient outcomes. My experience spans complex data modeling with SQL,
                            MongoDB, and DynamoDB, and integration of machine learning models and geospatial datasets to
                            support intelligent, data-driven healthcare delivery</p>

                            AUGUST 2020 – FEBRUARY 2022 <br> <br> As a Senior Python Developer at Prudential Financial, I led
                            end-to-end software development initiatives using Agile methodologies, with a strong focus
                            on delivering scalable, secure, and high-performing solutions in cloud-native environments.
                            I specialized in Python and AWS, architecting and deploying resilient RESTful APIs, managing
                            EC2 instances, and orchestrating containerized services via ECS. My DevOps expertise
                            included integrating Docker and Kubernetes to streamline CI/CD pipelines and enforce secure
                            deployments through VPCs, VPNs, and IAM policies. I also applied Site Reliability
                            Engineering (SRE) practices to enhance system reliability and implemented high-availability
                            AWS architectures. I leveraged FastAPI for rapid API development and built tools including
                            remote monitoring and management (RMM) utilities, Elasticsearch indices, BPMN models, and
                            Sqoop-based data workflows. My cloud experience extended across AWS and GCP, utilizing
                            services such as Lambda and Boto3 for automation and serverless operations. Additionally, I
                            contributed to full-stack development with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and
                            JavaScript, and back-end systems using .NET, C#, and SQL Server</p>

                            OCTOBER 2017 – JULY 2020 <br> <br>At Gainwell, I worked over a decade of software and web development
                            experience to architect and deliver scalable, secure, and cloud-native solutions. I was
                            instrumental in modernizing SaaS platforms and implementing SOAP web services while
                            developing business-critical applications using Python, Perl, and C. My work spanned across
                            Azure DevOps pipelines, UiPath-driven RPA automation, and building resilient Azure-hosted
                            Python applications. I led the transition to a microservices architecture with robust
                            RESTful APIs and integrated Azure Databricks for big data analytics. Key accomplishments
                            include designing secure authentication frameworks using Azure Active Directory and Google
                            Cloud IAM, and developing serverless FastAPI applications on GCP for dynamic, event-driven
                            services. I contributed across a wide range of projects—from e-commerce management systems
                            to message orchestration platforms and secure web portals, using Django, Kafka, Apache
                            Storm, and Matplotlib to build reliable data pipelines and insightful visualizations.</p>

                            delivering enterprise-grade solutions with a strong focus on quality and scalability. I
                            followed a test-driven development (TDD) methodology using Python’s unittest framework to
                            build robust backend systems with Django and PL/SQL, while also developing dynamic,
                            isomorphic React.js and Redux-based clients for the frontend. I ensured seamless
                            cross-browser compatibility with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery. My backend work involved
                            integrating complex SQL queries and deploying microservices on AWS, while streamlining
                            automation using Python, Shell scripting, XML, and custom test frameworks. I designed and

                            front-end development by building a responsive, user-centric web platform with enhanced UI
                            and intuitive functionality. Using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript within Eclipse, I developed
                            dynamic, cross-device-compatible pages and worked closely with backend teams to integrate
                            complex data flows using both custom and third-party components. I also implemented
